Of course the TOTAL price scares the renters away. It scares them because the total price was artificially inflated by traveler fees. In the state of FL dealers disclose dealer fee. Yes, I care of the overall price of the car, but I would not like it if I saw an ad online or in the newspaper for a car advertised for $20K, showed up at a dealership just to see that if I were to buy, it would cost me $21K because of dealer fee that was not disclosed in the ad.

In my market area, you can guess with high degree of accuracy by looking at the VRBO listings which listing is from one of THOSE PMs - badly written descriptions, reviews reflecting lack of maintenance, cookie cutter responses to the negative reviews, low star ratings. I would say owners are culpable too because owners think they can just turn their VR over to PM and forget about it. When they do, this is what they get - and soon this may end up being the bulk of HA \"inventory\".

In my market area, you can guess with high degree of accuracy by looking at the VRBO listings which listing is from one of THOSE PMs - badly written descriptions, reviews reflecting lack of maintenance, cookie cutter responses to the negative reviews, low star ratings. I would say owners are culpable too because owners think they can just turn their VR over to PM and forget about it. When they do, this is what they get - and soon this may end up being the bulk of HA \"inventory\".

I know several contractors in the area and constantly hear stories of how PMs handle repairs of the properties entrusted to them... And it is not the way any decent owner would want their property handled. In my market area, you can guess with high degree of accuracy by looking at the VRBO listings which listing is from one of THOSE PMs - badly written descriptions, reviews reflecting lack of maintenance, cookie cutter responses to the negative reviews, low star ratings. I would say owners are culpable too because owners think they can just turn their VR over to PM and forget about it. When they do, this is what they get - and soon this may end up being the bulk of HA \"inventory\".

I would say owners are culpable too because owners think they can just turn their VR over to PM and forget about it.

It is not my job to tell them that they are overreacting. It was up to me to defuse the situation and I did that. I apologized profusely, picked up the bullets immediately, and judged the situation.

He was contrite and he agreed. I also have no doubt that I could have asked him to provide a gift card to the new guests for his transgression because I handled it diplomatically.

I've been doing this too long to know that diplomacy is an important part of this job, and that a single upset guest can really screw up the reviews. The very last thing I wanted was a review where these guests mentioned finding bullets in the cottage. It would not reflect well on me, my property, or the area.
